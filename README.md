P   (Positives):                            Total duration of real speech segments (from reference labels)
TP  (True positives):                       Duration of correctly detected speech segments
FP  (False positives):                      Duration of incorrectly detected speech segments
FN  (False negatives):                      Duration of missed speech segments
TPR (True positive rate, sensitivity):      Probability that VAD detects a real speech segment. = TP / P 
PPV (Precision, Positive predictive value): Probability that detected speech segment is true.   = TP / (TP + FP) 
FNR (False negative rate, miss rate):       Probability that VAD misses a speech segment.       = FN / P 
FDR (False discovery rate):                 Probability that detected speech segment is false.  = FP / (TP + FP)

# Cloning

This project uses Git submodules.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/recursiveGecko/formula-vad
```

# Dependencies

* Zig: `0.11.0 master`. Requires ~`0.11.0-dev.3937+78eb3c561`.

* libsndfile:

  * On Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install libsndfile1 libsndfile1-dev`


# Simulator

A JSON file containing the run plan needs to be created, an example can be found in `tmp/plan.example.json`.

Any relative paths inside the JSON file are relative to the JSON file itself, not the current working directory.

Suggested optimization modes are either `ReleaseSafe` or `ReleaseFast`.

To run the simulator:

```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe && ./zig-out/bin/simulator -i tmp/plan.json
```
